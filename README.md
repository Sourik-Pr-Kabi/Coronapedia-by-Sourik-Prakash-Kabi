Hello I am Sourik Prakash Kabi, a third year engineering student. I made this webpage to try the UI application development processes that I'm trying to learn over past few months.
This webpage consists of four pages in total:
1. A home page
2. A registration page
3. A login page
  and finally
4. About the Author page

I like web development because it's technology domain in which there are multiple things to learn, and I love learning new things.

I plan on modifying this website once I learn some more complicated technologies. 

I'm a student and my web development skills needs much more perfection. I'll gladly accept any criticism or advice.
Do mail me: sourikkabi48@gmail.com

Enjoy the website!!
